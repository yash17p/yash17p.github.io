    <!-- Paragraph describing the education program -->
    <p>
        I am currently pursuing a Major in <b>Information Technology Management</b> with a <b>Computer Science Minor</b> at Toronto Metropolitan University.
        The program combines a love for technology, business, and management, offering a sound understanding of business principles alongside ICT-based innovation.
        Skills are honed through an optional co-op, case studies, and state-of-the-art classrooms and labs. Upon graduation, students anticipate, capitalize, and drive business strategies and opportunities tied to technological change.

    <h2>Most Useful Course</h2>
    <!-- Paragraph describing the most useful course -->
    <p>
        One course I found particularly useful and interesting is <b>ITM 751: Natural Language Processing for Business.</b>
        This course provides a theoretical and methodological introduction to current techniques, strategies, and tool-kits for natural language processing (NLP) from a managerial perspective.
        Through this course, I acquired experience in using Python to conduct textual and linguistic analyses and gained a practical understanding of natural language processing workflows.
